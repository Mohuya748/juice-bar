            <p>
            React is a JavaScript library that creates user interfaces .Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. we can use it to help build single page applications and mobile apps, or to build complex apps if you utilise it with other libraries.React works in declarative code.
            React offers various extensions for entire application architectural support, such as Flux and React Native, beyond mere UI.

    );
};

export default Question1;
