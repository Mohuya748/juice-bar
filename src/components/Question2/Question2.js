             useState is the first basic React Hook. useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. The useState hook allows us declare one or more state variables in function components. Under the hood, React keeps track of these state variables and ensures they stay up-to-date on subsequent re-renders of the component Whereas the state in a class is always an object, with Hooks, the state can be any type. Each piece of state holds a single value, which can be an object, an array, a boolean, or any other type you can imagine. It's especially useful for local component state.
